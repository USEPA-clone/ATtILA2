This file is intended to give a brief overview of what ATtILA is, how to install it, and where to find more information. For more detailed documentation, please see ATtILA's wiki located at https://github.com/USEPA/ATtILA2/wiki.

---------------
What is ATtILA?
---------------

ATtILA for ArcGIS Pro is an Esri ArcGIS toolbox that allows users to easily calculate many common landscape metrics. GIS expertise is not required, but some experience with ArcGIS is recommended. Three metric groups (toolsets) are currently included in ATtILA: Landscape Characteristics, People in the Landscape, and Riparian Characteristics, along with a Utilities section. ATtILA for ArcGIS Pro is written using the Python programming language and is designed to accommodate spatial data from a variety of sources.

Notice
-----------------------

This is a draft report distributed for review purposes only.  Please do not quote or cite.

When this document review is complete and the comments are incorporated, then the Notice will appear as follows:

“ATtILA for ArcGIS is a custom-designed ArcGIS-based toolbox created to simplify calculation of common landscape metrics.  While ATtILA for ArcGIS has been thoroughly tested for its intended uses, no warranty is explicitly implied, nor shall the act of distribution constitute any such warranty. ATtILA for ArcGIS is designed for use by government, professional, academic, and community users, as well as members of the public; a basic understanding of ArcGIS is necessary although the user need not be a GIS expert.  All modelled geographic data are, by their nature, imperfect and the data generated by ATtILA for ArcGIS should not be taken as absolute truth but as the best approximation of that truth based on best available data. Neither EPA, EPA contractors, nor any other organizations cooperating with EPA assume any responsibility for damages or other liabilities related to the accuracy, availability, use, or misuse of ATtILA for ArcGIS-generated outputs. EPA reserves the right to modify ATtILA for ArcGIS at any time without public notice. We welcome and encourage your feedback on all aspects of the application tools and will use that feedback for future upgrades of ATtILA for ArcGIS.

The United States Environmental Protection Agency through its Office of Research and Development funded and managed the development of ATtILA for ArcGIS.   It has been subjected to Agency and external scientific and administrative review and approved for distribution.  Mention of trade names or commercial products does not constitute endorsement nor recommendation for use.”

Installing ATtILA
------------------

This README provides basic information on installing ATtILA for ArcGIS Pro. For more detailed instructions on installing and using custom toolboxes in ArcGIS Pro, please see 'Connect to a toolbox' in ArcGIS Pro's Online Help.  New users should read through this wiki at least once to familiarize themselves with potential pitfalls associated with spatial data, ArcGIS limitations, or ATtILA for ArcGIS Pro processes.

REQUIREMENTS:
-------------

ATtILA for ArcGIS Pro requires ArcGIS Pro 2.6 or later and the Spatial Analyst extension.  ATtILA for ArcGIS Pro has not yet been tested on ArcGIS 3.0 or later versions.

INSTALLATION:
------------

1. Download the ATtILA for ArcGIS distribution zip file to a safe location, such as a Downloads directory.

2. Extract the contents of the ATtILA.zip file to a location where you commonly store personal Toolboxes, such as your ArcGIS directory under MyDocuments.  Ensure the ATtILA 10_0.tbx file and the ToolboxSource folder are at the same directory level. ATtILA for ArcGIS's directory structure is illustrated below:

    |
    |--Destination Folder
    |    |--ATtILA v2.tbx
    |    |--ToolboxSource\
    |         |--ATtILA2
    |              |--ATtILA2
    |                   |--constants
    |                   |--ToolValidator
    |                   |--utils
    |              |--scripts
    |                   |--bin
    |         |--LandCoverClassifications




3. Start ArcGIS Pro. Open Catalog View or Catalog Pane, and right click on Toolboxes. Click on Add Toolbox. 
    
4. Navigate to Attila2.tbx, select it and click OK.

5. Check to see if the toolbox installed correctly, i.e., open Toolbox to see tools contained within.

Python code for ATtILA was written by Don Ebert (EPA), Michael Jackson (EPA), BaoHong Ji (EPA), and Torrin Hultgren (EPA), with special assistance from Ellen D'Amico (Dynamac Corporation), and Doug Browning (EPA Student Services Contractor).

David Gottlieb (EPA Student Services Contractor) wrote the code for the Land Cover Coding Editor.

The original ATtILA ArcView extension tool was written in Avenue code by Don Ebert and Tim Wade with assistance from Dennis Yankee (Tennessee Valley Authority, Public Power Institute) who wrote code for the PCTIA_RD metric.
