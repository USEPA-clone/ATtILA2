# {FIELD} already exists error

When running the Road Density Metrics or the Stream Density Metrics tool, an error may occur indicating that a field already exists:

&nbsp;

![Image](<lib/ATtILA%20Field%20Already%20Exists%20Error.png>)

&nbsp;

This error may be caused by problems with the field used to classify the different road or stream features (Road class field or Stream order field, respectively). Specific rules for the length of the fields and the characters contained within the fields are found in each tool's help section.
