* **lccc\_TabArea\* table** - A table of areas corresponding to the values in the Land cover raster within each reporting unit. The name of the intermediate table has the prefix "lccc\_TabArea" followed by a number (e.g. lccc\_TabArea0, lccc\_TabArea1, lccc\_TabArea2, etc.). The number suffix is added when the table is saved in order to give each successive table a unique name when the tool is executed more than once and results saved to the same output location.
