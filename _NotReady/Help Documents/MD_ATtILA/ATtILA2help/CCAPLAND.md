# C-CAP LAND

C-CAP LAND&nbsp;

Water-related raster values are tagged as EXCLUDED. Excluded values are ignored when calculating the effective area of a reporting unit. Percentage metrics are based on the effective area of a reporting unit, not the total area.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Coefficient values for impervious area calculations are based on those reported in Caraco et al. (1998). Those supplied for the nitrogen loading and phosphorous loading estimates were obtained from Reckhow et al. (1980). As coefficient values can vary considerably for a given land cover type across locations, all provided values should be evaluated critically before use and altered when necessary.&nbsp;
