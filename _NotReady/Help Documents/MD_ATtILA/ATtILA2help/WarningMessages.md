# Warning Messages

When ATtILA for ArcGIS encounters a potential problem or an unexpected occurrence during the execution of one of its tools, it will attempt to relay that information to the user via ArcGIS's Results window. Depending on the situation, ATtILA for ArcGIS may provide potential solutions, possible consequences, or some other piece of information deigned useful to the user. In most cases, the message provided in the Results window will be sufficient to inform the user fully of the situation. In other cases, a more detailed explanation than what can be readily expressed in the Results window is necessary and a referral to the ATtILA for ArcGIS Help document is provided.

&nbsp;

Current warning messages that refer the user to the user manual are:

&nbsp;

* &nbsp;
  * [Excluded Values in Class Definitions](<ExcludedValuesinClassDefinitions.md>)
  * [Unable to Determine Conversion Factor](<UnabletoDetermineConversionFacto.md>)
  * [Undefined Values in LCC XML Document](<UndefinedValuesinLCCXMLDocument.md>)

&nbsp;

***NOTE:** For more information on examining and understanding the contents of the Results window, search on "Using the Results window" in the ArcGIS help documentation.*
