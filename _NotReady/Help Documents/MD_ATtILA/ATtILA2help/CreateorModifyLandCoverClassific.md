# Create or Modify Land Cover Classification

Summary&nbsp;

Create custom Land Cover Classification (LCC) files or modify existing files.

&nbsp;

The [External LCC Editor](<ExternalLCCEditor.md>) will be launched separately from ArcGIS. You may close ArcGIS without disrupting the editor. A LCC file defines the classification scheme and is a required input for some tools.

Usage

* Allows users to modify an existing LCC XML file to suit the their specific needs. For example, the user may define a new grouped class by combining multiple individual classes (e.g., deciduous, conifer, and mixed forest into a single forest class).&nbsp;
* Allows users to create a new LCC XML file for a land cover grid other than the standard datasets already included in ATtILA for ArcGIS (e.g. a local Land cover grid with a unique classification scheme).
