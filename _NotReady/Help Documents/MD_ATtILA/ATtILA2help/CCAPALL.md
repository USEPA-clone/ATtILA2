# C-CAP ALL

C-CAP ALL&nbsp;

No raster values except those representing NODATA are excluded from the calculation of reporting unit effective area (i.e., effective area equals the total raster area within a reporting unit).&nbsp;

&nbsp;

Coefficient values for impervious area calculations are based on those reported in Caraco et al. (1998). Those supplied for the nitrogen loading and phosphorous loading estimates were obtained from Reckhow et al. (1980). As coefficient values can vary considerably for a given land cover type across locations, all provided values should be evaluated critically before use and altered when necessary.&nbsp;
