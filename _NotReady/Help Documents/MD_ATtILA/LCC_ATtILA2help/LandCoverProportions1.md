# Land Cover Proportions

Intermediate File Retained

* **lcpTabArea\* table** - A table of areas corresponding to the values in the Land cover raster within each reporting unit. The name of the intermediate table has the prefix "lcpTabArea" followed by a number (e.g. lcpTabArea0, lcpTabArea1, lcpTabArea2, etc.). The number suffix is added when the table is saved in order to give each successive table a unique name when the tool is executed more than once and results saved to the same output location.
