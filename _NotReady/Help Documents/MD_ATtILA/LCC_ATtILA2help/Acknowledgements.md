Programmers

Python code for ATtILA for ArcGIS was written by Don Ebert (EPA), Michael Jackson (EPA), and Torrin Hultgren (Innovate\!, Inc.), with special assistance from Ellen D'Amico (Dynamac Corporation), BaoHong Ji (Innovate\!, Inc.), and Doug Browning (EPA Student Services Contractor).

&nbsp;

David Gottlieb (EPA Student Services Contractor) wrote the code for the Land Cover Coding Editor.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

The original ATtILA for ArcView extension tool was written in Avenue code by Don Ebert and Tim Wade with assistance from Dennis Yankee (Tennessee Valley Authority, Public Power Institute) who wrote code for the PCTIA\_RD metric.

&nbsp;

The following programmers were not directly involved with the project, but gave permission for their code to be incorporated into the original ATtILA and we greatly appreciate their generosity:
