# What is ATtILA?

ATtILA for ArcGIS is an Esri ArcGIS toolbox that allows users to easily calculate many common landscape metrics. GIS expertise is not required, but some experience with ArcGIS is recommended. Three metric groups (toolsets) are currently included in ATtILA for ArcGIS:&nbsp; Human Stressors, Landscape Characteristics, and Riparian Characteristics. ATtILA for ArcGIS is written using the Python programming language and is designed to accommodate spatial data from a variety of sources.

&nbsp;

This guide provides basic information on installing and using ATtILA for ArcGIS. It is not, however, meant to provide background in landscape ecology. It is the user’s responsibility to make appropriate use of ATtILA for ArcGIS output when conducting analyses or assessments. Users should also have some experience with spatial analysis and spatial data to ensure proper use of ATtILA for ArcGIS. New users should read through this manual at least once to familiarize themselves with potential pitfalls associated with spatial data, ArcGIS limitations, or ATtILA for ArcGIS processes. Important points are usually identified by italics in this document. A collection of appendices are included that contain a metric glossary, default land cover coding schemes, sample metadata, and more detailed information on some methods used in ATtILA for ArcGIS.&nbsp;

&nbsp;

ATtILA for ArcGIS was developed specifically to aid landscape ecology research being conducted by the US EPA.&nbsp; Consequently, the tools are named for their original usage (e.g., roads near streams) and the examples given in this document are drawn from landscape ecology analyses.&nbsp; However, other applications are possible and encouraged as long as the input data meet the requirements of the tool and the output meets the needs of the user.&nbsp; Instead of a layer of watershed polygons as the summary layer as given in the examples, the base summary layer could be counties, zipcodes, school districts, etc, as long as the input layer contains non-overlapping polygons and a unique identifier variable.&nbsp; Instead of roads or streams, any line data layer could be substituted, such as existing or proposed routings for transmission lines, railroads, or pipelines.&nbsp; Any discrete grid can be substituted for land cover data, with the user-defined classification option.&nbsp; It is the responsibility of the user to determine if the output of the tools meets the needs of their particular analysis.
