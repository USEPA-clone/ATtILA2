*“ATtILA for ArcGIS is a custom-designed ArcGIS-based toolbox created to simplify calculation of common landscape metrics.&nbsp; While ATtILA for ArcGIS has been thoroughly tested for its intended uses, no warranty is explicitly implied, nor shall the act of distribution constitute any such warranty. ATtILA for ArcGIS is designed for use by government, professional, academic, and community users, as well as members of the public; a basic understanding of ArcGIS is necessary although the user need not be a GIS expert.&nbsp; All modeled geographic data are, by their nature, imperfect and the data generated by ATtILA for ArcGIS should not be taken as absolute truth but as the best approximation of that truth based on best available data. Neither EPA, EPA contractors, nor any other organizations cooperating with EPA assume any responsibility for damages or other liabilities related to the accuracy, availability, use, or misuse of ATtILA for ArcGIS-generated outputs. EPA reserves the right to modify ATtILA for ArcGIS at any time without public notice. We welcome and encourage your feedback on all aspects of the application tools and will use that feedback for future upgrades of ATtILA for ArcGIS.*

&nbsp;

*The United States Environmental Protection Agency through its Office of Research and Development funded and managed the development of ATtILA for ArcGIS. &nbsp; It has been subjected to Agency and external scientific and administrative review and approved for distribution.&nbsp; Mention of trade names or commercial products does not constitute endorsement nor recommendation for use.”*
