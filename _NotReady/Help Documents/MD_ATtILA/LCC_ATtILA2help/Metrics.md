# Metrics

ATtILA for ArcGIS metrics are measurements of a component or components within the landscape, derived from combinations or overlays of data, which are used to characterize the composition and spatial configuration of those components in the landscape.&nbsp; A seminal work on metrics, which may be considered the genesis of ATtILA for ArcGIS, can be found in "*An Ecological Assessment of the United States Mid-Atlantic Region:&nbsp; A Landscape Atlas*" (Jones et al,1997). Many of the metrics originally conceived and developed for the atlas are included in ATtILA for ArcGIS.

&nbsp;

There are three toolsets in the ATtILA for ArcGIS toolbox: [**Human Stressors**](<HumanStressors.md>), [**Landscape Characteristics**](<LandscapeCharacteristics.md>), and [**Riparian Characteristics**](<RiparianCharacteristics.md>)**.** Each toolset is comprised of several tools for calculating metrics. Input data varies depending on the tool being used, and the dialog box for each tool guides the user, step by step, through the acceptable input data types and formats. Help is available from within each tool's dialog box by clicking the Tool Help button. Additionally, each required dataset is described in detail in the tool-specific sections of this manual.

&nbsp;

ATtILA for ArcGIS tools are extremely flexible and accept a wide range of data as input. Users are responsible for choosing data appropriate for their application or assessment.&nbsp; Spatial datasets are available from many sources, with a broad range of scales and spatial and thematic accuracy. There are numerous online clearinghouses that distribute many types of spatial data. Good places to start include the [Esri Data](<http://www.esri.com/data/data-maps/> "target=\"\_blank\"") Web site, the [Federal Geographic Data Committee's (FGDC) Geoplatform](<http://www.geoplatform.gov/resources> "target=\"\_blank\"") or the United States Geological Survey's (USGS) [National Map Viewer](<http://viewer.nationalmap.gov/> "target=\"\_blank\"").&nbsp; EPA's spatial data repository may be accessed through the [Geospatial Program](<www.epa.gov/geospatial/data.html> "target=\"\_blank\"") website. Datasets that cover the conterminous United States are available for download free of charge from these and other Internet sites. They are suitable for regional to national scale assessments. For local studies, higher resolution data is recommended, if available.

&nbsp;

ATtILA for ArcGIS tools are not restricted to use of particular datasets, but can be run with any input dataset that matches the required dataset type as defined in the tool-specific sections of this manual.&nbsp; Again, ***it is the responsibility of the user to select datasets of the appropriate type, format, and resolution for the metric analysis being performed***.
